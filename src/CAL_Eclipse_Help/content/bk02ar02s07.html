    <p>You may have noticed that many functions in CAL's standard libraries are implemented by
    calling local helper functions with more arguments. These extra arguments are called
    accumulating parameters and are used to store partial results required for the
    computation.</p>

    <p>For example, the definition of the length function is (essentially):<pre class="programlisting">length !list =
    let
        lengthHelper :: Int -&gt; [a] -&gt; Int;
        lengthHelper !acc !list =
            case list of
            [] -&gt; acc;
            listHead : listTail -&gt; 
                lengthHelper (acc + 1) listTail;
            ;
    in  
        lengthHelper 0 list;</pre></p>

    <p>The <em class="parameter"><code>acc</code></em> argument of lengthHelper represents the
    number of elements of the original list traversed so far while the <em class="parameter"><code>list</code></em> argument represents the remaining elements of the list yet to
    be visited. In a sense, these arguments can be considered as the partial results of the
    computation of the length of the original list. Since the <em class="parameter"><code>acc</code></em> argument is plinged, it will be a literal Int value at each
    reduction of lengthHelper. The standard definition of length is O(1) in space and O(n) in time.
    It is a key fact here that the accumulating parameter acc get evaluated to WHNF at each
    iteration. Sometimes this is accomplished by plinging, and sometimes through other means, such
    as the function naturally being strict in a given argument.</p>

    <p>As an aside, the recursive call to lengthHelper is <span class="emphasis"><em>tail-recursive</em></span>.
    From a performance point of view this is a good thing in that the lecc runtime will not use any
    heap in making the recursive call. At the java byte code level it is implemented as a goto.
    However, even without the tail-recursion optimization, length will be O(1) in space and O(n) in
    time, so the existence of the tail-recursion optimization is not a key point in understanding
    why length is implemented as it is. However, the tail-recursion optimization is an important
    topic in its own right and will be covered in another Effective CAL essay. A point to note now
    though is that it does not fundamentally affect asymptotic performance characteristics of your
    algorithm, but only the proportionality constant. (It can have a rather dramatic improvement on
    the proportionality constant though, since a goto instruction is much faster than allocating
    memory on the heap).</p>

    <p>An alternative definition of length that does not use an accumulating parameters helper
    would be:<pre class="programlisting">//warning- this is an example of how not to write length
lengthAlt :: [a] -&gt; Int;
lengthAlt !list = 
   case list of
   [] -&gt; 0;
   listHead : listTail -&gt;
       1 + lengthAlt listTail;
   ;</pre></p>

    <p>Although this definition is O(n) in time, it is also O(n) in space. Moreover, it is also
    O(n) in stack! To verify this, running an expression such as:<pre class="screen">lengthAlt (upFromTo (1::Int) 10000)</pre>on
    the ICE console will result in a java.lang.StackOverflowError being reported.</p>

    <p>The first hint that a problem will occur is that reducing an application of lengthAlt to
    WHNF results in a literal Int. However, to return a literal Int from the recursion step of
    <pre class="screen">1 + lengthAlt listTail</pre>requires that the second argument of the <code class="code">+</code>
    operator, namely lengthAlt listTail be itself evaluated to WHNF. This requires a recursive call
    on the stack to obtain the result before the addition can be done. Eventually he function
    application will reduce to an intermediate computation of (1 + (1 + (1 + (..... )))) which when
    evaluated will run out of stack.</p>

    <p>The solution in this particular case is to do the additions of 1 in an incremental
    fashion, one list element traversal at a time, rather than wait until the list is entirely
    traversed.</p>

    <p>A general principle here is that it is bad to write directly recursive functions that
    perform computations in their returned value expression.</p>

    <p>Listed below is essentially the definition of the List.reverse function. It uses a local
    recursive helper function reverseHelper, which has accumulating parameters source and result. At
    each recursive call, an element of source is moved to result. So result can be considered to be
    the partially reversed list, and source can be considered to be the part of the original list
    that still needs to be reversed.<pre class="programlisting">reverse :: [a] -&gt; [a];
reverse !list =
    let
        reverseHelper :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a];
        reverseHelper !source result =
            case source of
            [] -&gt;
                result;
            headSource : tailSource -&gt;
                reverseHelper
                    tailSource (headSource : result);
            ;
    in
        reverseHelper list [];</pre></p>

    <p>reverse is an interesting contrast to the previous example of length, since its result
    type, [a] is a lazy type. However, the reverse function itself will return a list whose spine is
    fully evaluated, even though the elements themselves are not evaluated. It is O(n) in time and
    O(n) in space, where n is the length of the list to reverse. If the argument list is an infinite
    list, reverse not terminate.</p>

    <p>Here is a more direct definition of reverse that does not use accumulating parameters.
    <pre class="programlisting">//warning- this is an example of how not to write reverse
reverseAlt :: [a] -&gt; [a];   
reverseAlt !list = 
   case list of
   [] -&gt; [];
   listHead : listTail -&gt;
       reverseAlt listTail ++ [listHead];
   ;</pre></p>

    <p>This definition is still O(n) in space, but it is O(n^2) in time. To see this, note that
    the reduction to WHNF of<pre class="screen">reverseAlt [1 :: Int, 2, 3, 4, 5]</pre>eventually reaches the
    step:<pre class="screen">(((([] ++ [5]) ++ [4]) ++ [3]) ++ [2]) ++ [1]</pre></p>

    <p>Now, <code class="code">++</code>, the append class method on List, is O(n) in time, where n is the
    length of its first argument list. It doesn't take any time at all handling its second argument
    list. This is because <code class="code">++</code> only needs to copy (the spine) of its first argument list,
    and not the second argument list- it can just reuse that value. (For details see the
    implementation of Prelude.appendList).</p>

    <p>Thus, we can see the reason for the O(n^2) time behavior of reverseAlt- it is applying the
    append operator in a left associative way, when the work is being done in the first argument.
    This is precisely the wrong way to do it! As an aside, this is why the <code class="code">++</code> operator
    is right-associate so that an expression like:<pre class="screen">[] ++ [5] ++ [4] ++ [3] ++ [2] ++ [1]</pre>in
    fact parses as:<pre class="screen">[] ++ ([5] ++ ([4] ++ ([3] ++ ([2] ++ [1]))))</pre>and thus can be
    evaluated without excessive copying of intermediate lists.</p>

    <p>Note that the accumulating parameters pattern is also useful for accumulating several
    partial results. The Tutorial_Fibonacci module has several different examples and a discussion
    on creating efficient functions for computing the Fibonacci numbers. One of those efficient
    functions, fib2, uses three accumulating parameters. This makes sure that the state needed to
    efficiently perform the computation is available at each recursive step, and in a sufficiently
    evaluated form. It is analogous to how such a Fibonacci function would be efficiently
    implemented in Java, except that the use of mutable local state variables in Java is replaced by
    the accumulating parameters. The CAL version is much more declarative and equally as efficient
    as the Java version.<pre class="programlisting">fib2 :: Int -&gt; Integer;       
fib2 !n =
    let
        /**
         * Computes the nth fibonacci number
         * (where n is defined in the enclosing scope
         *  as the argument to fib2).
         * @arg i an index (will be &lt;= n)
         * @arg fib_i_minus_1 the (i-1)th fibonacci number
         * @arg fib_i the ith fibonacci number
         * @return the nth fibonacci number
         */
        fibHelper :: Int -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer;
        fibHelper !i !fib_i_minus_1 !fib_i =
            if i == n then
                fib_i
            else
                fibHelper
                    (i + 1) fib_i (fib_i_minus_1 + fib_i);
    in
        fibHelper 1 0 1;</pre></p>
