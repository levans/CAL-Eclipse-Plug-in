    <p>Another place where plinging is used is in algebraic type definitions. This is a more
    fundamental concept than plinging of function arguments because plinging of data constructor
    arguments, unlike plinging of function arguments, can not be inferred by the compiler - it
    expresses something about the design intent of the type. For example, Haskell supports plinging
    of data constructor arguments, but not plinging of function arguments (although Haskell
    indirectly supports the semantic effects of plinging of function arguments via the seq
    function). Plinging of data constructor arguments is a useful technique for controlling both the
    space usage of programs during evaluation, as well as the in-memory footprint of already
    evaluated values.</p>

    <p>Each field of each data constructor within a type can be either plinged or unplinged. For
    example, in LazyPair, none of the fields are plinged, in StrictPair both fields are plinged, and
    in FirstStrictPair only the fst field is plinged. <pre class="programlisting">data LazyPair a b =
    LP
        fst :: a
        snd :: b
    ;

data StrictPair a b =
    SP
        fst :: !a
        snd :: !b
    ;

data FirstStrictPair a b =
    FSP
        fst :: !a
        snd :: b
    ;</pre></p>

    <p>Plinging of the fields of a data constructor affects how that data constructor is reduced
    to WHNF. In particular, when evaluating a data constructor to WHNF, the plinged fields will
    first themselves be evaluated to WHNF, in the order in which they are declared in the data
    constructor's definition.</p>

    <p>For example, evaluating<pre class="screen">(LP 7.0 (error "pear")).LP.fst</pre>returns the value
    7.0 while evaluating<pre class="screen">(SP 7.0 (error "pear")).SP.fst</pre>terminates in an error and
    displays "<code class="computeroutput">pear</code>" on the console. This is because in the LazyPair
    case, evaluating the data constructor field selection first causes<pre class="screen">LP 7.0 (error "pear")</pre>to
    be evaluated to WHNF. It is already in WHNF, and so evaluation can proceed with returning the
    value of the fst field. However, in the StrictPair case, evaluating<pre class="screen">SP 7.0 (error "pear")</pre>to
    WHNF first involves evaluating 7.0 to WHNF and then (error "pear") to WHNF. At this point
    evaluation terminates with the error call.</p>

    <p>Note that if the SP expression above is itself never evaluated to WHNF, then the error
    call will not occur. For example, the following expression returns 3.0:<pre class="screen">(3.0, SP 7.0 (error "pear")).#1</pre></p>

    <p>One consequence is that when a plinged data constructor is in WHNF, then its plinged
    fields are also in WHNF. This has the semantic effect that types with plinged fields have fewer
    values than a similar type with unplinged fields. Plinging data constructor fields is a useful
    technique for controlling the space usage of a program. For example, it is impossible for an
    evaluated value of type StrictPair Int Int to hold onto a bulky unevaluated computation in one
    of its fields, since they must be evaluated to WHNF, which in the case of Int means a simple Int
    literal value. A similar effect can be had with LazyPair by always constructing its values using
    a helper function such as lazyPair: <pre class="programlisting">lazyPair !x !y = LazyPair x y;</pre>Since
    the x and y arguments of lazyPair are plinged, this will do the trick.</p>

    <p>The LazyPair type is very similar to the standard CAL tuple type (a, b). Tuple and record
    types in CAL always have lazy fields. A similar technique of controlling space usage when
    constructing CAL tuples is to use a function such as pairStrict, discussed in the previous
    essay:<pre class="programlisting">pairStrict !x !y = (x, y);</pre></p>

    <p>When a field is plinged, and the declared type of the field is a foreign type (or an
    enumeration type, which is internally represented as an int), then the storage requirements for
    evaluated values of the field are much less than if the field were not plinged.</p>

    <p>For example, an evaluated StrictWidget internally holds onto 4 field values with Java
    types: java.lang.String, int, double, java.lang.Object. An evaluated LazyWidget holds onto 4
    field values all of Java type org.openquark.cal.machine.CalValue, which is the Java
    implementation type of the CAL type Prelude.CalValue. If the field values of a LazyWidget value
    are eventually reduced to WHNF then there will be one level of indirection to values of the
    underlying Java types mentioned above.<pre class="programlisting">data StrictWidget =
    SWidget
        name :: !String
        id :: !Int
        price :: !Double
        other :: !JObject
    ;

data LazyWidget =
    LWidget
        name :: String
        id :: Int
        price :: Double
        other :: JObject
    ;</pre></p>

    <p>I mentioned above how plinging can affect the set of values that a type can represent.
    This is especially pronounced in the case of recursively defined algebraic types. For example,
    shown below are four different list types, varying in their strictness
    constraints:<pre class="programlisting">data LazyList a = 
    LNil | 
    LCons 
        head :: a
        tail :: (LazyList a) 
    deriving Eq, Ord;

data HeadStrictList a =
    HSNil | 
    HSCons 
        head :: !a
        tail :: (HeadStrictList a) 
    deriving Eq, Ord;

data TailStrictList a =
    TSNil | 
    TSCons 
        head :: a
        tail :: !(TailStrictList a) 
    deriving Eq, Ord;

data StrictList a =
    SNil | 
    SCons 
        head :: !a
        tail :: !(StrictList a) 
    deriving Eq, Ord;</pre></p>

    <p>LazyList is essentially identical to CAL's standard list type, Prelude.List. LazyList and
    Prelude.List perform no evaluation unless needed by a client, and can be used to represent
    infinite data structures, such as a stream of generated outputs with no preset termination.
    However, they can be more inefficient if sooner or later all the list elements are
    evaluated.</p>

    <p>StrictList is similar (but not identical to) CAL's Array type. The similarity lies in that
    whenever an Array, or StrictList is evaluated to WHNF, then all of its elements are first
    evaluated to WHNF. In particular, a StrictList can not be used to represent an infinite list in
    a useful way i.e. such that reduction to WHNF succeeds.</p>

    <p>For example, here are the definitions of 4 infinite lists alternating the elements 1.0 and
    (error "apple"):<div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting">lazyList1 = LCons 1.0 (LCons (error "apple") lazyList1);</pre>
      </div><div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting">headStrictList1 = HSCons 1.0 (HSCons (error "apple") headStrictList1);</pre>
      </div><div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting">tailStrictList1 = TSCons 1.0 (TSCons (error "apple") tailStrictList1);</pre>
      </div><div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting">strictList1 = SCons 1.0 (SCons (error "apple") strictList1);</pre>
      </div></p>

    <p>Evaluating an expression to extract the first element of lazyList1 or
    headStrictList1:<pre class="screen">lazyList1.LCons.head
headStrictList1.HSCons.head
</pre>both return <code class="computeroutput">1.0</code>.</p>

    <p>Evaluating the third element of lazyList1:<pre class="screen">lazyList1.LCons.tail.LCons.tail.LCons.head</pre>also
    returns <code class="computeroutput">1.0</code>.</p>

    <p>However, evaluating the third element of headStrictList1:<pre class="screen">headStrictList1.HSCons.tail.HSCons.tail.HSCons.head</pre>terminates
    in an error, displaying "apple" on the console. This is because during the list traversal, when
    unpacking the second HSCons node, the head field is evaluated, resulting in the call to error
    since the second element is (error "apple").</p>

    <p>Evaluating an expression to extract the first element of strictList1:<pre class="screen">strictList1.TSCons.head</pre>terminates
    in an error at the reduction point when the second element value is evaluated, displaying
    "apple" on the console.</p>

    <p>However, evaluating an expression to extract the first element of tailStrictList<pre class="screen">tailStrictList1.TSCons.head</pre>does
    not terminate in an error, since elements of the list itself are never evaluated. However, it
    does hang (eventually resulting in a java.lang.StackOverflowError). This is because the infinite
    list must be fully expanded out (without its values being evaluated) before the head value can
    be returned.</p>
