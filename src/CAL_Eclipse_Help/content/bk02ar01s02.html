          <b>CAL is simple to use for interacting with real world
          environments.&nbsp;</b>

          <br xmlns:fo="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format">CAL takes a practical approach to interacting with the real
          world. This is one of the defining differences between CAL and
          Haskell, and was one of the main motivators for us in implementing a
          different language. For example, in the "History of Haskell" paper
          by Paul Hudak et al, in section 3.2 it says that "Once we were
          committed to a lazy language, a pure one was inescapable". Of
          course, Haskell supports functions like unsafePerformIO, so there
          are qualifications to this statement, but the general philosophy is
          an emphasis on purity, and this is usually stated right at the
          beginning as a requirement if one adopts the lazy approach.
        </p>

        <p>In contrast, CAL takes a more pragmatic approach. CAL's foreign
        function and type API lets programmers import any Java method, field
        or constructor as a CAL function, and any Java type as a CAL type.
        This makes it easy and convenient to access the rich array of Java
        libraries available with minimal effort. The drawback is that these
        imported types may be mutable, and the imported functions may not be
        pure. However, the imported functions and types can be made private to
        a module and CAL wrapper functions written to make the public
        functions actually exposed by the module pure.</p>

        <p>CAL supports various mechanisms to make it easy to control
        laziness and evaluation order in cases such as writing the wrapper
        functions mentioned above. These are also quite useful for dealing
        with certain classes of space leaks in a simple way. For example, CAL
        supports seq, deepSeq, plinging of function arguments and plinging of
        data constructor arguments. In addition, CAL has an eager function
        primitive that tells the code generator to not create a lazy thunk for
        an expression, but just compile strictly.</p>

        <p>Any algebraic function created using algebraic CAL types and
        non-foreign functions is pure. Impurity in the language only arises
        via the foreign API when referring to non-immutable Java types. We
        have found that the use of wrappers often lets us localize the
        impurity in a simple way. One canonical example is with the function
        <code class="function">outputListWith :: [a] -&gt; (a -&gt; JObject) -&gt;
        JList</code>, where JObject and JList are CAL foreign types for
        the Java types java.lang.Object and java.lang.List respectively. The
        implementation involves calling a foreign function to create a new
        java.util.ArrayList, and then adding elements of the CAL list to it,
        using an element marshaling function. In particular, the created Java
        list is mutated in the body of the function. However, due to
        strictness annotations, this happens in a definite order, and the
        resulting function outputListWith is pure.</p>

        <p>Another technique for localizing state is through the use of
        execution context properties. It is frequently the case that state,
        such as the current time zone, is locally constant over a computation.
        CAL has an execution context, into which clients can set such state
        for the duration of an execution. Constant applicative form (CAF)
        values are also tied to an execution context.</p>

        <p>In addition, the execution context gives clients control over
        the execution of a CAL program. For example, they can request that the
        CAL program suspends execution.</p>

        <p>Another example of the practical nature of CAL is that CAL's
        String type is a foreign type with implementation type
        java.lang.String and not [Char].</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <b>CAL is a low-risk choice for business applications.&nbsp;</b>

          <br xmlns:fo="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format">Since CAL programs can be distributed as a collection of Java
          JARS with no other run-time support required, CAL based applications
          have the platform independence and security of a Java application.
          This makes CAL based applications more acceptable in situations
          where conservative IT policies are in place.
        </p>

        <p>In addition, standard tools and practices for working with Java
        based applications work for CAL. For example, people are very familiar
        with deploying JARs. Many people know how to configure and tune a JVM
        for heap size, garbage collection characteristics etc. Tools used to
        diagnose runtime problems, such as profilers and debuggers, work with
        CAL.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <b>Programs do not need to be entirely written, or even
          primarily written in CAL.&nbsp;</b>

          <br xmlns:fo="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format">We wanted to create a language where it was possible to
          introduce strongly typed lazy functional programming in the places
          where it makes sense, but be able to coexist with teams that did not
          use or know how to use this technology. We wanted to lower the
          barrier of entry to obtaining the benefits of CAL by being able to
          localize its use to the situations where the advantages were most
          dramatic.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <b>CAL has extensive runtime language creation
          capabilities.&nbsp;</b>

          <br xmlns:fo="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format">Whole CAL modules can be programmatically created, checked,
          and compiled on the fly. Essentially all of the services of the CAL
          compiler and runtime are accessible to the application programmer at
          runtime in an efficient way. For example, new modules, or functions
          can be created, checked for correctness, and executed without going
          through slow intermediate formats (such as a source language textual
          representation) and without creating any intermediate files on disk.
          This is done in a fully multi-threaded way, both for compilation and
          execution.
        </p>

        <p>One illustration of parts of this functionality is with the
        GemCutter tool which is used for creating CAL functions (Gems) in a
        graphical environment. The GemCutter provides rapid feedback to the
        user as to whether a connection between functions is type correct,
        suggests valid connections, and allows for the execution of gems in
        such a way that unsatisfied arguments have their values prompted for
        at run-time.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <b>CAL seeks to be as comfortable as possible for mainstream
          developers to use.&nbsp;</b>

          <br xmlns:fo="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format">One of our design goals was to make CAL as simple and
          comfortable as possible for mainstream developers to use. In
          particular, while we wanted to make extensive use of concepts and
          ideas from the strongly typed functional world, consistency with the
          notation, terminology and programming style of this world was not a
          main priority.
        </p>

        <p>For example, we wanted to use longer, more descriptive, less
        mathematical names, as is common in Java. The Haskell functions null
        and nub are isEmpty and removeDuplicates in CAL. The Haskell type
        class Monoid is Appendable in CAL.</p>

        <p>We wanted to use longer variable names in our code, including in
        the standard libraries, and explain, in comments, why things were
        implemented the way they were. Our comments follow the Java
        conventions in syntax and in style.</p>
